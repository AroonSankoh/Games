# Games

This repo contains a couple games I created in Java on my own time. Currently they include BlackJack and StreetCraps, but I plan to add more using my Card and Game packages.

Clicking on the src folder will show you BlackJack, Cards, Game, and StreetCraps. Clicking on the BlackJack and StreetCraps folders will take you to the relevant Java files to play the games (usually titled *MainGame.java*). Cards and Game are packages I created to increase the reusability of my game class, and they are especially helpful for making multiplayer card games! The last folder is support/cse131, which contains support files from my Introduction to Computer Science class taught by [Bill Siever](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Bill-Siever.html) and developed by [Ron Cytron](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ron-Cytron.html) that allow a program to prompt a user for input. Please email me at **aroonjsankoh@gmail.com** if you have any questions or suggestions regarding the game class!

Thanks!
